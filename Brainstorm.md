# VERAVITA BRAINSTORM

## Tools the SR needs: (SR = session runner)

Planning:
1. Worldbuilding. How do they make custom content? Locations? Is there an easy way to insert/remove existing content?
2. Narrative building. What shape does a quest look like? How does a quest relate to the overarching narrative? How do things happen in the background? How do you track them? How much is happening?

Creation:
1. Characters. Cypher system. How can creating an NPC be made fast and effortless? Can you do it on the fly? How can you make an NPC who doesn’t require laborious creation rules but who also feels like a PC? How can you easily keep track of NPCs and the developments in their stories? How can you remember their voices? Adjective noun catchphrase.
2. Locations. Cypher system. Smell, touch, sound, and taste. What is happening in the background? What makes this location unique (story related or for a sense of intrigue and wonder)? How can the SR easily remember what is inside of this location/how this location relates to others. What is north, east, south, and west of the location?
3. Monsters. What is its strength and weakness? What are its motivations? What will it do when left alone? What other ways are there to deal with it?
4. Abilities. How are abilities categorized and distributed according to category? Are abilities subject to scale? How does an SR make a new ability and judge its scale? What are the drawbacks? Do the drawbacks balance out the strength mechanically?

Running:
1. SR devised scenes. Guide SR into creating a space where play leads to narrative advancement.
2. Calling scenes. How can players go to another location and witness something they are interested in regarding the side-plot that is happening there? How can this instances of play maintain its playfulness in the absence of character sheets and abilities? (table or examples of motivations/secret motivations)
3. Downtime? Stuff like resting, travelling, waiting, recovering, etc. how can it feel mechanically fair without involving a whole scene?
4. Scale. How to tell stories of asymmetric power?
5. Combat. How is ‘health’ represented? How does a move feel impactful if it doesn’t ‘damage’? When are dice rolled and when are hitches resolved? What are the present threats and how long do players have to deal with them, and can they prevent them during combat?

Progression:
1. Player character. How and when does a player advance? Is scale narrative or mechanical? How does progression factor into survival and vice versa.
2. Abilities. How do I build complexity into the simplistic? How can abilities continue to scale beside or in spite of mechanics? How can something like a crafting progression happen outside of the character mechanics?
3. Narrative. How can the narrative advance on scales that differ from the magnitude of the player characters?
4. Home base. What is required to improve a location? What mechanical benefits do players get from it? How can I prevent locking those benefits to a list of specific things?
