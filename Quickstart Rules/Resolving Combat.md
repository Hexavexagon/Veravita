To resolve a situation, you need to pay the appropriate amount of resources.

To determine the amount of resources to pay, you must:
1. How much of a threat is it?
2. What solutions will stop the threat?
3. What parts of the threat do you know about?
4. What parts do you not know about?

A character will judge a threat according to their perception and what they know about it. It's possible they will under or overestimate it.

In order to defeat it, a player must pay over the required number.

If they succeed, the threat -reduces- and a new round starts. It reduces by the amount they overshoot.

If they fail, they learn more about the threat. If there were hidden aspects to it increasing the threat level, they might learn one. If not, they may learn a narrative hint, such as: "it can't be defeated without ice magic".

For each round the threat still exists, something bad happens to the players. What happens is usually based on the strengths the threat has. ie. if it drains life, it might reduce someone's Vita.
