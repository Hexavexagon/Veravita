# Prime Rules
These are the main concepts that govern how the game should be run. They are not strictly -more important- than other rules, they just exist specifically to create a better experience by keeping them in mind. Think of them as things you should think about during play, as opposed to other rules being things to look up when you need to know them.



# Do not roll for actions that are not contested
If an action is not actively being hindered by an external force, such as an enemy or a rainstorm, then simply accept that it works without fail. This rule isn't intended to simulate the accurate competence level of a character, but rather to prevent boring results. Failing in a low stakes situation isn't interesting. Even if everyone at your table is invested in playing out failures, I'd still recommend moving on quickly to situations where they are more meaningful.

# Success is not always perfect
It's worth noting that a success doesn't mean there is no cost. Some actions may require some form of loss, such as bribing a guard, while others may involve some form of danger, such as revealing that you have a Warmage calling.

Costs and dangers are not weapons for you to punish players, but tools for you to create a more interesting narrative with your players.

# There is no symmetry
Veravita is designed to tell stories where some people are stronger than others. It's designed to tell stories where some threats are insurmountable. It's designed to tell stories where you can kill gods and still have something to fear. There is no need to police the strength of a character, nor carefully plan out the strength of each encounter. No matter how strong someone gets there will always be several layers of danger above them, and personal desires they can lose.
