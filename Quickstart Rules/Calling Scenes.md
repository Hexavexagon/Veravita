# Calling a Scene
Any player may call a scene once one naturally ends by requesting to view what is happening in a particular location. It can be helpful for the GM to ask the player what characters they expect to see there or what they think is happening, but ultimately the decision of what to hide/show and who is where lies with the GM. If it makes things easier, determine before a session a list of scenes the players want to see.

When you enter a new scene, focus on the actions of a small group of characters, and allow each player to claim a character they wish to play. Follow these basic rules:
 * If a player is at the table, no one else can play their main.
 * If the scene involves support characters bonded to one player, they choose first which character they will play.
 * Each character significant enough to be played by a player has a few essential pieces of data:
  1. A simple sentence about how they speak and what they sound like.
  2. An overarching motivation for their life.
  3. Their default method of solving problems.
 * Additionally, the GM or bonded player may give players a secret motivation they are trying to achieve during this scene. Have fun with this.
