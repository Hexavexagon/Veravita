# Domains
A domain is an area of knowledge a character excels at, whether through study, or having learnt by harsh life experiences. Simply having a domain tells the Session Runner to reveal extra information to you that might be relevant to your area of expertise.

Domains also come with specialties. Having a domain assures you have the fundamental knowledge of that topic, but having a specialty tells you the context through which you are used to applying that knowledge.

Specialties: labyrinths, gods, aspects, history, calamities, absolutes, regards.

# Marebito
The marebito domain is the study of those who have experienced some kind of reincarnation or soul-swapping event. It also concerns the study of the vessel, the spiritual space in which the soul is kept; and the study of midspace, the dimensional connection between worlds. Most of how marebito experiences actually work is unknown, and the domain is mostly concerned with the analysis of folklore, as there simply aren't enough living subjects to study.

Specialties: vessels, midspace, soul swaps, soul shares, reincarnation.

# Slayer
The slayer domain concerns the subjugation of dangerous threats in accordance with the will of the Slayer's Association. More than simply fighting, it involves a lot of survival knowledge and ecology in order to truly understand a target.

Specialties: anything that is common and safe enough to learn how to kill it. Rarer or more dangerous beasts are not granted such study due to lack of expertise.
