Forms of magic that is banned:
* Warmages - considered too dangerous to exist
* Storage magic - links to the demon realm
* Teleportation magic - too dangerous in general, but also can be used for assassination, and has many unpredictable side effects


"The demon realm" exists. It's just the "midspace" in which storage magic exists.

Such magic is now looked down upon as heretical by all major faiths, and is largely banned in any kingdom.

Royalty:
* Oldest sibling who everyone feels is too powerful and competent. Thought of by everyone as having such ruthless aspiration that they will do anything to take the throne. Actual motivation is to outshine their siblings so much that there isn't any point in fighting for succession, meaning their precious younger siblings will all be safe.
* Older sister who is very over-protective of her younger sister around men, falsly accusing them of things. This is because she was formerly engaged to an asshole who also sought to marry her sister after she broke off the engagement.
* Younger sister who denounced her claim for the throne to avoid marrying said guy.
