# Lore Details
"The demon realm" exists. It's just the "midspace" in which storage magic exists. Over many years of using storage magic to keep items in the space between dimensions, the space began to get cluttered with horrible beasts and powerful relics. Such magic is now looked down upon as heretical by all major faiths, and is largely banned in any kingdom.

Ancient hero who founded a clan of ninja who have a lot of Japanese traditions. You think he's Japanese until you learn that his name was Ryan Tennyson, and he was just and American weeb.
