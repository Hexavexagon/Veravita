## Beastfolk
'Beastfolk' are actually humans (or other races) who are born with various traits of animals because of their ancestors being spiritwhispers. Many cultures revere them for their adjacent to divinity nature, but some discriminate against them.

## High
All races can be a 'high' variant, which essentially describes an entity granted divinity by a numeni. All high variants are immortal (in some form). Typically they don't age. High variants are sometimes visually indistinguishable from regular races, but usually have a distinct look. Some cultures know how to identify them in various ways, and usually revere them, but others are none the wiser.
