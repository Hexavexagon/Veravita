## Vataria de Silvas il Demora
A group dedicated to maintaining the power balance of the world. Most of them are calamities. They work under cover and mostly concern themselves with watching reincarnators and killing them if they seem too dangerous (decided based on their personality and power). They will also hunt anything else particularly dangerous, like calamities, gods, aspects, domains, etc. They are not specifically in Astarius, but operate globally, so if a threat appears they might also. The name is hard to translate because it belongs to the archaic form of an uncommon language. A linguistic scholar might be able to translate it, but even they would struggle.


## Heavy Thrall
The heavy thrall is a divine curse that takes the form of some common beast. It appears before people and tries to buy authority over their weight. If it succeeds, it adds that weight to its own. Though it may seem initially harmless, its mastery over weight and the sheer inertia it contains within itself make it incredibly dangerous if you agitate it.

## The Eternal Mezata
A glowing, antlered newt monster who heals.
Raspy toddler. "Your? people? call me?... Mezata? My? people? Do not? talk?... This? is all new? to me?"

A calamity formed when a newt-like healing monster absorbed the blood of hundreds of other creatures. Typically mezata are killed easily by adventurers and slayers, often prioritized because of their healing ability. They look like a newt with six small antler-like protrusions, and have a gentle green glow and porous skin that absorbs things easily. A mezata typically couldn't fight off someone who wanted to kill it, but thanks to the human (mostly) form she gained and her almost immortal regeneration, the eternal mezata could win a fight she was forced into. She's very timid about injuries, and sees people as bringers of destruction, so how she is approached will change what the situation becomes. She can talk, but is new to forming human voices. As a human she has vein-like red patterns mottled all over her skin.
