# Map - The Flourish
An interracial alliance that maintains nature.

The Flourish is a place maintained by a collective of races who live in an alliance. It's known as The Flourish because the various races within it specialize in looking after different domains, sky, forests, caves, etc. so their coexistence in one space has an unintended effect of making the land incredibly bountiful. This makes it an economically strong trading partner, but also a self-reliant society.

### Location - The Flashing Forest
A mystical forest that teleports people.
At night the dead stillness of the forest is sporadically interrupted by bright flashes and susurrant fizzles that seem to linger in your ear for too long.

The Flashing Forest is a forest full of teleport magic that can be seen activating at night. It serves as a gateway to The Flourish and keeps out those who don't know exactly how to navigate it.
