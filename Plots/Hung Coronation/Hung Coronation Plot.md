# Your Goals
* The Association commissions you (a group of slayers) a survey regarding the propagation of hangman's vine in the northern reaches. You are given a small leather cylinder and told to ensure you have enough supplies for the whole survey period. You know the cylinder contains further instructions to be read in private away from the city.
* When you open the cylinder, or arrive at your destination, you will find out that the mission given to you in secret is to smuggle the second princess into the duke's estate under cover of night.
* If you complete the survey, you may encounter a Calamity who has healing powers - the reason the hangman's vine is growing so well. She needs your help to hide from people so that they don't kill or kidnap her.
* You must cross the northern reaches with the princess in order to reach the next town over, in which the duke's estate resides. During this time supplies may be fraught. If you sleep in the forest at night near any hangman's vine, you may wake to find it covering you, as if it were the monster version (it isn't).



## Leather Cylinder
This is the association's method of handing out secret missions under the guise of a regular commission. What you know about it is it's intended for you to open in complete privacy, preferably outside of the city. The contents of your regular commission are usually planned to give you good cover for completing your actual mission, so it's likely you are being sent to the place you need to go and some subtle hints may have been given.

## Hangman's Vine
An epiphytic vine that grows from the base of a limb out to the tip, forming a connection near the leaves. It will drain vitality from the tree, allowing it to grow at a much faster pace, eventually causing its midsection to droop off the limb. As it continues to droop more and more it eventually begins to twist around itself, forming the semblance of a noose.

Regular hangman's vine is not dangerous to people, but because it can easily kill trees it causes trouble to the ecosystem (falling trees are dangerous to people, though). The variation of hangman's vine that has become a monster is also not very dangerous to people, but has the ability to grow at an alarming speed (only sporadically). The ends of its vines can also attach to people and drain their nutrients, but it's easily avoided by anyone with the knowledge that it should be avoided.

## The Second Princess
The second princess is young and shy and pretty scared, having never been in a deep forest with a bunch of strangers. You meet her alongside an association member who has been watching over her until your arrival. He looks ragged. He hasn't slept for a while.

## The Astarius Crown Succession
The crown rightfully should be succeeded by first princess, Divinity Astarius, but it's known in the court that the king himself favours second princess, Katelyn Astarius to take the crown (feeling Divinity's pacifism unsuitable to a ruler despite her cold demeanor), and those who favour a naive ruler they can manipulate have machinations in place to make that happen. The second prince, Tsuya Astarius, believes he can claim the throne without hurting his sisters, but most of his faction are willing to kill them against his wishes. Meanwhile, the real Katelyn is presumed dead, and the one who now flees the succession battle is her body double, Asceta Mossgrove, who holds no interest in (or rightful claim to) the throne. The king is actually one of the few people who know Asceta is not Katelyn, and is the one who organised sending her to duke Salver.

## The Eternal Mezata
A calamity formed when a newt-like healing monster absorbed the blood of hundreds of other creatures. Typically mezata are killed easily by adventurers and slayers, often prioritized because of their healing ability. They look like a newt with six small antler-like protrusions, and have a gentle green glow and porous skin that absorbs things easily. A mezata typically couldn't fight off someone who wanted to kill it, but thanks to the human (mostly) form she gained and her almost immortal regeneration, the eternal mezata could win a fight she was forced into. She's very timid about injuries, and sees people as bringers of destruction, so how she is approached will change what the situation becomes. She can talk, but is new to forming human voices. As a human she has vein-like red patterns mottled all over her skin.
"Your? people? call me?... Mezata? My? people? Do not? talk?... This? is all new? to me?"






Difficulty is a scale of 0-5.
The target number is how many successes you must roll.
You dont need to roll for 0, but you can if you want to flex.
If you do not meet the target number, you get a perk for each success, and must resolve a hitch.

Targets for fighting things usually start at 5 if you don't know how to fight them.



pejorative name for soldiers: translates to "dirt snack".
